%% Simple Test Scenario for CS/S3 compatible Storage Solutions
%% Store and retrieves 1MB documents
%%
%% 1. Use a new, not-yet-existing bucket name for {cs_bucket, ....}
%% 2. Run this test 3 times, each time un-comment another action. 1st put, 2nd get, 3rd delete
%%
%% That should leave you with an empty bucket again
